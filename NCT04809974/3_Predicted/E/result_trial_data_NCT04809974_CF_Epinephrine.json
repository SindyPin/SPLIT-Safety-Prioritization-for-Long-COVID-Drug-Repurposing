[COUNTERFACTUAL ANALYSIS] Original drug (Niagen) replaced with Epinephrine. Original summary: The study will assess whether Niagen, a safe dietary supplement, improves recovery of COVID-19 related symptoms in individuals who were infected at least 2 months prior to study entry (\"Long-COVID\" \"Long-haulers\"). 60% of participants will receive Niagen and 40% will receive PBO. Outcomes will consist of standardized cognitive, neuropsychiatric, physical, functional and biomarker assessments.
