Original summary: The study will assess whether Niagen, a safe dietary supplement, improves recovery of COVID-19 related symptoms in individuals who were infected at least 2 months prior to study entry (\"Long-COVID\" \"Long-haulers\"). 60% of participants will receive Niagen and 40% will receive PBO.
