[COUNTERFACTUAL ANALYSIS] Original drug (Niagen) replaced with Clonidine. Original summary: The study will assess whether Niagen, a safe dietary supplement, improves recovery of COVID-19 related symptoms in individuals who were infected at least 2 months prior to study entry (\"Long-COVID\" \"Long-haulers\"). 60% of participants will receive Niagen and 40% will receive PBO. Outcomes will consist of standardized cognitive, neuropsychiatric, physical, functional and biomarker assessments. Replacement drug: Clonidine  Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ at least 2 months prior to study entry;\n* SARS-CoV-2 negative (PCR) at study entry;\n* Persistent cognitive difficulties (esp. \"brain fog\") that began around the time of the acute COVID-19;\n* At least two neurological and/or physical symptoms that started with COVID-19 infection and are ongoing at study entry, including fatigue, weakness, headache, loss of smell, tingling/numbness, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, palpitations/tachycardia, hair loss, musculoskeletal and/or chest pain;\n* Willing and able to consent, complete all assessment and study procedures;\n* Not pregnant or lactating.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any specific central nervous system disease history (e.g. major clinical stroke, brain tumor, normal pressure hydrocephalus, etc);\n* Clinically significant unstable medical condition that could affect safety or compliance with the study;\n* Was intubated due to COVID-19;\n* Major active or chronic unstable psychiatric illness (e.g. depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia) within the previous year;\n* History of alcohol or other substance abuse or dependence within the past two years;\n* Any significant systemic illness or medical condition that could affect safety or compliance with study;\n* Current use of medications with psychoactive properties that may be deleteriously affecting cognition;\n* Any known hypersensitivity to nicotinamide riboside, or its principal metabolite, nicotinamide mononucleotide;\n* Use of other investigational agents or interventions one month prior to entry and for the duration of the trial;\n* If participating in the optional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sub-study: Any contraindication to undergo MRI;\n* Pregnant women or women who are planning to become pregnant within 7 months from study entry.",
