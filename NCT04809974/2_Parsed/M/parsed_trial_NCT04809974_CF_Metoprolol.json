Individual RBANS index scores range from 40 to 160, and the Sum of Index Scores (sum of five index scores) ranges from 200 to 800. Higher index scores reflect better cognitive performance. The TMT-B score is the completion time in seconds, with a maximum time of 5 minutes. A lower time is indicative of a better performance. Change scores reflect the difference from Baseline to Week 10, and from Week 10 to Week 20. Positive change scores on the ECog indicate worsening subjective cognitive decline. Positive change scores on the RBANS indicate improvement. Positive change scores in the TMT-B represent worsening performance.",
