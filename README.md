> **Integrating Causal Driver Genes with Clinical Knowledge Graphs for Safety-First Drug Repurposing in Long COVID**

A computational framework that combines causal gene discovery with clinical knowledge graph learning to identify drugs that should be **avoided** (deprioritized) for Long COVID clinical trials based on unfavorable predicted safety, toxicity burden, and efficacy profiles.

---

## 🎯 Overview

![SPLIT Framework Workflow](Workflow_final.png)

**SPLIT** addresses a critical gap in drug repurposing: rather than simply ranking candidates by predicted efficacy, we prioritize **safety-first deprioritization**—systematically identifying drugs with unacceptable risk-benefit profiles before they enter costly clinical trials.

### Key Features

- **Multi-method causal gene discovery**: Integrates Mendelian Randomization (MR), Control Theory (CT), and Differential Causal Effects (DCE) to identify 1,725 Long COVID driver genes
- **Knowledge graph-based prediction**: Uses PlaNet to generate cohort-anchored predictions of safety (S), adverse events (AE), and efficacy (E)
- **Counterfactual trial design**: Evaluates drugs within fixed cohort contexts by substituting interventions while preserving protocol structure
- **Multi-tier deprioritization**: Generates complementary avoid lists (composite, threshold-based, counterfactual-delta) with configurable stringency
- **Pharmacology enrichment**: Contextualizes predictions with wet-lab evidence from PubChem, ChEMBL, Open Targets, and DailyMed
- **Cross-validation with active trials**: Compares avoid list drugs against ongoing Long COVID clinical and preclinical programs

## 📊 Key Results

### Causal Gene Landscape

| Evidence Source | Genes |
|-----------------|-------|
| Control Theory (CT) | 1,641 |
| Mendelian Randomization (MR) | 50 |
| Differential Causal Effects (DCE) | 45 |
| **Multi-method convergent** | **11** |
| **Total unique genes** | **1,725** |

### Safety-Coverage Trade-off

A critical finding: **maximizing causal gene coverage does not improve efficacy but substantially compromises safety**.

| Drug | Causal Genes | Safety (S) | Efficacy (E) |
|------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Niagen (Original) | — | 0.549 | 0.519 |
| Leronlimab | 1 | 0.441 | 0.521 |
| Vortioxetine | 11 | 0.332 | 0.521 |
| Ritonavir | 70 | 0.215 | 0.527 |

### Deprioritization Outputs

From 1,625 screened drugs, we generated multi-tier avoid lists for two clinical cohorts:

#### NCT04809974 (Cognitive Cohort)

| List Type | Threshold | Drugs (n) | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Primary q05 | Worst 5% | 82 | Core deprioritized set |
| Primary q10 | Worst 10% | 163 | Default threshold |
| Primary q20 | Worst 20% | 325 | Extended set |
| Threshold-based | Any extreme | 855 | ≥1 extreme flag |
| Multi-extreme | ≥2 flags | 121 | Highest concern |
| Delta (vs Niagen) | Any worse | 456 | Worse than original |

**Total unique drugs**: 883

#### NCT04880161 (Respiratory Cohort)

| List Type | Threshold | Drugs (n) | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Primary q05 | Worst 5% | 82 | Core deprioritized set |
| Primary q10 | Worst 10% | 163 | Default threshold |
| Primary q20 | Worst 20% | 325 | Extended set |
| Threshold-based | Any extreme | 803 | ≥1 extreme flag |
| Delta (vs Ampion) | Any worse | 412 | Worse than original |

**Total unique drugs**: 824

**113 drugs** appear in all three avoid list types for NCT04809974, representing the highest-confidence deprioritization targets.

## 🧪 Cross-Reference with Active Long COVID Trials

A key validation of our framework: several drugs appearing on avoid lists are simultaneously under investigation in active Long COVID clinical trials, supported by preclinical evidence. This underscores that avoid lists function as **hypothesis-generating filters** for specific cohort-drug combinations, not universal exclusion criteria.

### Drugs on Avoid Lists with Active Long COVID Clinical Programs

#### NCT04809974 (Cognitive Cohort) — 4 Drugs

| Drug | Avoid Lists | Long COVID Trial | Phase | Preclinical Evidence |
|------|-------------|------------------|-------|---------------------|
| **Baricitinib** | All 9 files | REVERSE-LC (NCT05858515) | Phase 3 | In vitro: inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry via NAK blockade in 3D liver organoids; Mouse: reverses neurocognitive deficits in SCID model |
| **Naltrexone (LDN)** | 6 files | RECOVER-TLC pivotal trial | Phase 2/3 | In vitro: restores TRPM3 ion channel function in NK cells from Long COVID patients (Sasso 2024) |
| **Ibudilast** | 4 files | Phase 2-3 RCT | Phase 2-3 | In vitro: PDE4/PDE10 inhibition reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines; BBB penetrant |
| **Ritonavir** | 2 files | RECOVER-VITAL (NCT05576662) | Phase 3 | In vitro: nirmatrelvir IC₅₀ ~19nM against 3CL protease; effective in Vero E6, Calu-3 cells |

#### NCT04880161 (Respiratory Cohort) — 9 Drugs

| Drug | Avoid Lists | Long COVID Trial | Phase | Preclinical Evidence |
|------|-------------|------------------|-------|---------------------|
| **Baricitinib** | 4 files | REVERSE-LC (NCT05858515) | Phase 3 | JAK1/2 inhibition blocks IL-6, IFN signaling |
| **Ibudilast** | 4 files | Phase 2-3 RCT | Phase 2-3 | Reduces TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 in vitro |
| **Rosuvastatin** | 7 files | Observational studies | Observational | Endothelial anti-inflammatory effects |
| **Metformin** | 2 files | COVID-OUT (Phase 3 completed) | Phase 3 | Reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication by 99% in Caco2/Calu3 cells; AMPK→mTOR inhibition |
| **Ivabradine** | 3 files | RECOVER-AUTONOMIC | Phase 2/3 | Selective If channel inhibition in sinoatrial node cells |
| **Modafinil** | 2 files | RECOVER-SLEEP | Phase 2/3 | Wake-promoting via dopaminergic/histaminergic pathways |
| **Guanfacine** | 3 files | Open-label studies | Phase 2 | α2A-agonism strengthens prefrontal cortex connectivity in primate models |
| **Atorvastatin** | 3 files | Observational studies | Observational | Reduces endothelial inflammation markers |
| **Ritonavir** | 2 files | RECOVER-VITAL | Phase 3 | Hamster/mouse models confirm viral load reduction |

### Key Insight

The presence of drugs like **baricitinib** (flagged across all avoid lists for NCT04809974) as the leading immunomodulator candidate in the $12M REVERSE-LC trial illustrates that:

1. **Context matters**: A drug flagged for avoidance in combination with nicotinamide riboside may be beneficial as a standalone intervention
2. **Avoid lists are cohort-specific**: Safety-efficacy profiles depend on the specific trial population and co-interventions
3. **Preclinical validation exists**: These drugs have robust wet-lab evidence supporting their investigation in Long COVID

## 📖 Methods Summary

### Stage A: Causal Gene Discovery

1. **Mendelian Randomization (MR)**: Identifies genes with genetically-anchored causal effects on Long COVID risk using GWAS + GTEx eQTL data
2. **Control Theory (CT)**: Identifies network-indispensable nodes whose removal disrupts system controllability
3. **Differential Causal Effects (DCE)**: Quantifies pathway-level gene-gene interaction differences between Long COVID cases and controls

### Stage B: Drug-Gene Mapping

- Maps 1,725 causal genes to pharmacological modulators using DrugBank, ChEMBL, TTD, DrugCentral, and GtoPdb
- Screening panel: 1,776 drugs with ≥11 causal gene targets

### Stage C: PlaNet Prediction

- Generates cohort-anchored predictions of Safety (S), Adverse Events (AE), and Efficacy (E)
- Uses counterfactual trial design to evaluate drug substitutions within fixed cohort contexts

### Stage D: Safety-First Deprioritization

- **Primary composite**: Ranks by weighted combination of S, E, and inverse AE
- **Threshold-based**: Flags drugs with extreme values on individual metrics
- **Counterfactual-delta**: Identifies drugs worse than the original trial intervention

### Stage E: Cross-Reference Validation

- Compares avoid list drugs against active Long COVID clinical trials (RECOVER, REVERSE-LC, etc.)
- Annotates with preclinical/wet lab evidence (in vitro, animal models)
- Confirms hypothesis-generating (not exclusionary) nature of avoid lists
